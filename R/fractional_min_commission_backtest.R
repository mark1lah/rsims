#' Equities Minimum Commission Backtest using Fractional Numbers of Shares
#'
#' @description Identical function to min_commission_backtest, except it allows
#' for dealing in fractional shares. This is useful when simulating assets that
#' have undergone splits that result in split-adjusted prices that are so large
#' as to prevent the granularity needed when constrained to doing integer lots
#' of shares (think UVXY).
#'
#' This is imperfect, but is a decent trade off when the price series has been
#' adjusted by orders of magnitude.
#'
#' Quasi event-based simulation based on target share weights,
#' prices, commissions and interest.
#'
#' The function is quite opinionated with respect to the data that it expects.
#' The idea is that user effort is spent in upstream data wrangling, and the
#' payoff is an extremely efficient backtesting routine, enabling fast
#' experimentation with parameters such as `trade_buffer` and different
#' commission models.
#'
#' @param prices Matrix of trade prices. Column 1 must be the timestamp or index.
#' @param unadjusted_prices Matrix of unadjusted prices. Column 1 must be the
#' timestamp or index. Used to calculate commission based on actual number of
#' shares traded.
#' @param target_weights Matrix of target weights. Column 1 must be the
#' timestamp or index.
#' @param interest_rates Matrix of daily interest rates applied to unused cash
#' (positive interest) and borrowed cash (negative interest). If not passed,
#' assumes constant interest rate of zero.
#' @param short_borrow_costs Named vector of annualised short borrow costs as percent. For
#' example, c("TLT" = 0.0025) is equivalent to a short borrow cost of 0.25%pa for
#' TLT. Defaults to zero.
#' @param trade_buffer Trade buffer parameter (see details)
#' @param initial_cash Inital cash balance
#' @param capitalise_profits If TRUE, utilise profits and initial cash balance in determining position sizes. If FALSE, profits accrue as a cash balance and are not reinvested.
#' @param commission_fun Function for determining commissions from prices and
#' trades
#' @param ... Additional arguments passed to commission_fun. For
#' `us_tiered_commission`, this will be `max_pct_per_order` (the maximum
#' commission as a percentage of order value), `min_dollars_per_order` (the
#' minimum commission in dollars of a single order), `dollars_per_share` (the
#' per-share cost in dollars - for IB fixed tier, 0.005 is reasonable).
#'
#' @return long dataframe of results consisting of the following columns:
#'  ticker: Ticker or Cash
#'  date: In YYYY-MM-DD format
#'  close: Closing price (adjusted).
#'  shares: Number of shares held.
#'  exposure: Value of exposure to current ticker or to Cash.
#'  share_trades: Number of shares traded, including any positions that
#'  were liquidated fully or partially.
#'  trade_value: Value of shares traded, including any positions that
#'  were liquidated fully or partially.
#'  commission: Commissions paid on today's trading, including any liquidated
#'  positions.
#'  interest: Interest accrued on yesterday's cash balance and settled today.
#'  short_borrow: Borrow costs from holding yesterday's short positions through
#'  today's close.
#'  margin_call: Boolean indicating whether a margin call occurred today.
#'  reduced_target_pos: Boolean indicating whether target positions could not be
#'  executed due to insufficient margin, and were scaled back accordingly.
#'
#' @details
#' `target_weights`,  `prices`, `unadjusted_prices`, and `interest_rates` should
#' be date-aligned.
#'
#' The function will error if these matrixes are of different
#' shape, or have different values in Column 1 (the date or index column).
#' A simple approach to ensuring inputs conform with this requirement is in the
#' vignette.
#'
#' It is up to the user to lag `target_weights` as necessary to ensure that
#' trades occur at appropriate prices. Specifically, the function assumes that
#' `target_weights` are date-aligned with `prices` such that the price at which
#' you assume you trade into a target weight has the same index value.
#'
#' `interest_rates` are the daily percentage interest rate applied to the cash
#' balance. It is up to the user to ensure this is in the correct format (for
#' instance dividing by 100*365 if your raw data is in percent per-anum), and to
#' apply a broker spread if necessary.
#'
#' The function assumes a margin requirement of 0.25 the value of the shares
#' held and will liquidate positions if this requirement is not met (ie will
#' simulate a margin call).
